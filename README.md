# HDS-Fragmenter

HDS-Fragmenter is a tool for splitting HTTP Dynamic Streaming (HDS) segment files (.f4f), as generated by Adobe's f4fpackager, into individual fragment files. These fragments can be uploaded and played from a regular web server or a cloud service like Amazon S3, removing the need for the apache-origin module.

## Installation

HDS-Fragmenter requires node.js and makes use of the npm package tool for managing the required dependencies. Before getting started, be sure to install the necessary local dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

After installation of the dependencies, you'll be able to run the software.

## Usage

HDS-Fragmenter should be run from command line using the following command:

```
$ node extract --input <HDS manifest (.f4m) file> --output [directory to store the HDS fragments]
```

## Limitations

HDS-Fragmenter currently only supports DRM-free video segments, if you have any inquires or requests about DRM functionality for HDS-Fragmenter do not hesitate to [contact](mailto://contact@opentelly.com) us.
